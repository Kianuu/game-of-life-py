# 2d games

Hi. 

My name is Kian, this is on my github page I guess. I'm creating a representation of conway's game of life, well I was until I figured I wanted to do interesting things with it so I said hey, why not just make it an actual game. So I am, right now I'm trying to do it in pygame, but in the future I might try it in a different language (c, c++, rust, zig, etc). The goal here for me is to learn how to actually develop an application from scratch, going from drawing out what I want it to look like, writing out logic trees or looking at my IDE blankly for hours trying to figure out what I actually want the code to do. 

Bonus point if I find a library or API meant for this usecase or any future usecases (online / 3d rendering / etc). 

So hopefully, by the end of this I'll feel more like a developer I guess? Or I'll have a cool project I can talk about lol. 

Anyways, thanks for reading I guess. If you got this far, I probably won't be merging any pull requests because I'd like to try doing it myself first for the "learning experience". But feel free to fork it if you like. So far the project is only using PyGame but dearpygui might be of use in the future as will other things with the different languages. 

Cheers! 

Kianuu
